### Notable Projects or Cool Technologies Implemented

* **3rd Party Subscription Project**
 Architected and developed a 3rd party subscription framework for a large brokerage firm. Worked closely with 3rd parties to develop an encrypted scheme to share sensitive data. User's were able to subscribe to 3rd party content through firms website.

* **Content Delivery**
	For off-shore clients where a CDN is used I researched and found ways to optimize the delivery of both assets and data. Also used Ilya Grigorik's <a target=_blank href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Il4swGfTOSM >Breaking the 1000ms Time to Mobile Barrier</a> as a model for delivering content to mobile devices.
* **Yeoman and Code Generation**
    Me and a few colleagues created a code generator using Yeoman as a DWYWD project at Markit. While we did not achieve our ultimate goal we were able to demonstrate some important pieces of our POC. THe project also demonstrated the power of code generators and how quickly they speed up dev time.
